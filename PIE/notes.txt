Possible Class structure:
 data
  text
  graphics
  tables
  asm
  music
  combo

data (abstract)
methods:
 display();
 edit();
 write();
 update();
properties:
 stream parentStream;
 byte[] data -- add
 int start;
 length;

things to do with text:
 (multi) table support
 program control codes

things to do with graphics:
 allow for different color depths, bitmaps
 editing
 have different tile layouts
 sprite viewing/mapping/editing
 tile maps

things to do with tables
 pointers
 tilemaps
 sprite data
 generic data (numbers, words, characters)

things to do with asm
 display it
 rudimentary code interpretation/system emulation
 edit it

things to do with combo
 allow it
 data object followed by another data object
 possibly combine with tables?

things to do with music
 play
 display (loops, notes)
 edit


project file - probably going to be an xaml document describing the different slices set up

program features
 export - not the entire thing, but individual parts (text, graphics, tables, etc.)
 action history - it would be nice to have undo/redo functionality in the program
 different views - be able to see the data in different ways (hex, text, graphics mostly)
 ability to slice file into banks of different sizes
 ability to split data into sub-groups
 ability to transform data and work on it
  by decompressing it using common algorithms
  by running assembly over the code
 ability to change line info offset
 ability to change font

todo:
ensure that no overlap occurs when slicing
allow the user to change to starting address (done)
allow dragging and dropping of tree nodes (done)
implement a sort on the treeview (maybe?)
create a way of updating other slices when editing a slice
get a project file format up and running
expose more of the hexbox properties for modification (bytes per row, byte grouping, line/column info, etc)
 hexbox properties to expose:
  Backcolor
  ForeColor
  Bytes per line
  Byte Location (enable/disable)
  Font
  Group Separator (enable/disable)
  Group Size
  Hex casing (upper/lower)
  Address Color?
  Line Address (enable/disable)
  String Value (enable/disable)

stretch:
create an insert mode where, starting at a certain point, bytes get overwritten when inserting:
  01 02 03 | 04 05 + 00 = 00 01 02 | 04 05
