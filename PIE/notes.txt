Possible Class structure:
 data
  text
  graphics
  tables
  asm
  music
  combo

data (abstract)
methods:
 display();
 edit();
 write();
 update();
properties:
 stream parentStream;
 byte[] data -- add
 int start;
 length;

things to do with text:
 (multi) table support
 program control codes

things to do with graphics:
 allow for different color depths, bitmaps
 editing
 have different tile layouts
 sprite viewing/mapping/editing
 tile maps

things to do with tables
 pointers
 tilemaps
 sprite data
 generic data (numbers, words, characters)

things to do with asm
 display it
 rudimentary code interpretation/system emulation
 edit it

things to do with combo
 allow it
 data object followed by another data object
 possibly combine with tables?

things to do with music
 play
 display (loops, notes)
 edit

program features
 export - not the entire thing, but individual parts (text, graphics, tables, etc.)
 action history - it would be nice to have undo/redo functionality in the program
 different views - be able to see the data in different ways (hex, text, graphics mostly)
 ability to slice file into banks of different sizes
 ability to split data into sub-groups
 ability to transform data and work on it
  by decompressing it using common algorithms
  by running assembly over the code
 ability to change line info offset
 ability to change font

what to save?
 project
 slice
 file

todo:
  finish table display
  show unused space in a slice in projectTreeView as slices (disabled)
