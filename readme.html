<h3><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>PIE is a file editor which allows for multiple views of the same file.  It does this by isolating parts of the file, allowing each part to be viewed differently.  The purpose of this editor is to allow for a user to easily view and edit files containing multiple types of data (executables, archives, roms, etc.).  The goal for this editor is to support the editing and viewing of the most common forms of data, allowing for less common types via plugins and the import and export of data.  For the initial release, the program consists of a basic hex editor with some nice features and the ability to create "slices" from a file.</p>
<h4><a id="What_is_a_slice"> What is a Slice?</a></h4>
<p>A slice is a contiguous, static-size, non-overlapping section of data derived from either another slice or the file itself.  Each slice can be further subdivided into smaller slices.  Unrelated slices—those slices that do not share data in common—are treated as separate entities and do not affect each other.  When used correctly, each slice should represent a specific entity within the file, such as a code bank, text, or a table.</p>
<p>As an example, let's suppose we have a rom which is divided into 16 kilobyte banks, each bank containing various types of data.  When loaded, each bank occupies the same address space.  Slices allow us to partition the file into 16 kilobyte banks, each able to be viewed with the correct address space.  Further, each slice can be subdivided to isolate the different types of data contained in the bank.</p>

<h3><a id="Projects">Projects</a></h3>
<p>In order to save all the slice metadata associated with a project, PIE uses project files.  These project files are xml documents that store the data associated with each slice as well as the entire project.  Included in the project file is the directory of the file associated with the project.  If the file is moved, PIE will search in the project directory for the file.  But if it can't find it in either location the project will fail to open.</p>
<h4><a id="Creating_a_Project">Creating a Project</a></h4>
<p>Before you can begin editing a file, you must create a new project.  You can do this by either clicking on the "New Project" button in the toolbar or by clicking on "File" and selecting "New Project."  PIE will then ask you to select the file to be associated with the project.  After you have selected the file, it will open and be ready to edit.</p>
<h4><a id="Saving_a_Project">Saving a Project</a></h4>
<p>To save a project, click on "File" and select "Save Project."  If this project is newly created, PIE will ask you what you want it named and where you want to save it.  After clicking save, the project file will be created.</p>

<h3><a id="Hex_Editor">Hex Editor</a></h3>
<p>The hex editor is the base way in which to view and edit data in PIE.  While currently it is also the only way to edit data, all current and future slices can be viewed via the hex editor.</p>
<h4><a id="Editing_Data">Editing Data</a></h4>
<p>The hex editor can overwrite and insert data.  You can do this by either entering hexidecimal values or ascii characters.  The hex editor also allows for standard copy/paste actions:
<ul>
<li><dfn>copy</dfn> - copies the selected data to the clipboard</li>
<li><dfn>cut</dfn> - copies the selected data to the clipboard and then removes the data.</li>
<li><dfn>paste</dfn> - inserts data from the clipboard at the cursor location</li>
<li><dfn>paste over</dfn> - overwrites data at the cursor location using the contents of the clipboard</li></ul></p>
<h4><a id="Finding_Data">Finding Data</a></h4>
<p>To find a certain string of hex or ASCII characters, click on "Find" under the "Edit" menu.  PIE will open another window with the following fields:
<ul>
<li><dfn>hex</dfn> - allows you to search for a hex string.  Note that if you are searching for a hex string, keep in mind that PIE will add a <kbd>0</kbd> to the beginning of an odd number of characters.  So, a search for <kbd>f10</kbd> would submit a search for <kbd>0f10</kbd>.</li>
<li><dfn>ascii</dfn> - Let's you search for an ascii string.</li>
<li><dfn>Match Case</dfn> - if ascii is selected, this allows you to make your string search case sensitive.</li>
</ul>
Click "Find" to begin your search.  To go to the next search result, click on "Edit" and select the "Find Next" option.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a id="Slices">Slices</a></h3>
<p>Slices are the main way that data is managed and viewed.  All existing slices are shown in a tree structure to the right of the main program.  To view a specific slice, double click on the slice or select it and either Select "Show" under "Slice" or by right-clicking.</p>
<h4><a id="Creating_Slices">Creating Slices</a></h4>
<p>There are multiple ways to create slices.  The quick and easy way is to highlight a section of data,  and either right click and select "Slice" or click the slice button.  If successful, the new slice is created and displayed in the project view.</p>
<p>To manually create a slice, select the slice to slice and select "Slice..." by either right-clicking or by selecting the "Slice" menu.  This will open another window with the following options:
<ul>
<li><dfn>Name</dfn> - Enter the name of the slice here</li>
<li><dfn>Start</dfn> - This is the relative starting address of the slice</li>
<li><dfn>End</dfn> - This is the relative ending address of the slice</li>
<li><dfn>Notes</dfn> - Input any notes or further information about the slice here</li>
<li><dfn>Specify Size</dfn> - This allows you to specifiy the size rather the end address</li>
<ul>
<li><dfn>Size</dfn> - This replaces End and specifies the size of the slice</li>
<li><dfn>bytes</dfn> - Specified the magnitude of the size specified</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Once you are done, click "Slice" and the new slice(s) will be created.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When creating a slice, make sure that it lies within the bounds of the slice you are creating it from and that it does not overlap another slice.  Otherwise, you will recieve an error.  If you get an error, change the slice bounds until the slice you are attempting to create is valid.</p>
<h4><a id="Copying_Slices">Copying Slices</a></h4>
<p>If you create a slice and would like to duplicate it, select the slice and click on "Clone..." by either right-clicking or by going into the "Slice" menu.  This will open another window with the following options:
<ul>
<li><dfn>Start</dfn> - Specified the start address of where the clone is to be placed.</li>
<li><dfn>Include Sub slices</dfn> - If checked, the cloned slice will copy the entire slice structure, not just the base slice.</li>
<li><dfn>Repeat over the Slice</dfn> - If checked, starting at the start address the slice is cloned until it fills the slice</li>
</ul>
Note that cloning a slice will only clone the slice structure, not the data within the slice.  Once you are done, click clone to copy the slice.</p>
<h4><a id="Modifying_Slices">Modifying Slices</a></h4>
<p>If the slice you create is the wrong size, it can be resized by selecting the slice and selecting "Resize..." from either the right-click menu or from the "Slice" menu.  This will open another window with the current bounds.  After you have edited them to your satisfaction, click OK for the resize to take effect.  Note that, just like when creating a slice, the bounds you specify must not overlap another slice and must be within the bounds of the parent slice.</p>
